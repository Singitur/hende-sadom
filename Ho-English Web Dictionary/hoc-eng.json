(The exact words spoken are used followed by the required form of the verb men, Les. 35,36). Men is not used when in English we have an indirect object, ‘to say to ...’; in that case meta, q.v. would be used. When meaning ‘say instead of a full verb form merely the root men is used 1) when quoting replies made by some third person, e.g. Kań hhućoḱać men, ‘He says that he will not come’ or 2) when emphasizing one’s own words, e.g., Kań senoḱań men, ‘I say that I will not go’ (after having already Said it and the hearer did not hear or insisted to the contarary); The passive form menoḱ is used meaning ‘to be said', 'to be called something, e.g. nena chikana; menoḱa, ‘what is this called?', but it is also used meaning 'to say or reflect to one’s advantage’; men is also used in the same way as menteaḱ or mena instead of mente, ‘that’ (following direct discourse) when the word for saying is a noun, e.g. Haturen Kui ko kako paeṭia men kajido banoḱa, ‘The fact is not that village women do not work’"
